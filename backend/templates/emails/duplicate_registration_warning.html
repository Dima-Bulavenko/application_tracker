<h2>Someone tried to register with your email</h2>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>
  We received a request to create a new account using your email address ({{
  email }}) on Application Tracker. Since you already have an account with us,
  we wanted to let you know about this attempt.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>ðŸ”’ Your account is secure</strong><br />
  No changes have been made to your existing account. If this was you, you can
  simply log in using your existing credentials.
</div>

<p>If you didn't attempt to create a new account, please consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Someone may have accidentally used your email address</li>
  <li>Checking if your password is strong and unique</li>
  <li>Contacting us if you have security concerns</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you forgot your password, you can reset it using the password reset feature
  on our login page.
</p>

<div class="text-center">
  <a href="{{ login_url }}" class="button">Go to Login Page</a>
</div>

<p class="text-muted mt-0">
  If you have any questions or concerns about your account security, please
  don't hesitate to contact our support team.
